## Project Overview

In this project, we explore the capabilities of CNNs and Transfer Learning for image classification. We use a dataset of brain MRI images to classify different types of tumors. The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model architecture definition using CNN and Transfer Learning
- Training and evaluation scripts

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

For a full list of requirements, refer to the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.
